Additional forms of participation include: Board calls, Board email list discussions, working groups, working group list discussions, and Board votes, which are detailed below.","Board members are volunteers. Therefore, members do not have to participate in every working group or every list discussion. However, participation should be enough such that all Board members have confidence in each other that everyone is doing their part to drive the program forward in a positive direction. In this regard, should a Board member lose the confidence of a majority of other Board members, a removal action may be taken. Prior to this step, individual Board members may contact the member of concern directly, or may choose to voice their concerns through the Secretariat, so that issues are effectively communicated to the member of concern so that an understanding of the situation is developed in an effort to arrive at a fair outcome. Whether done by individual Board members or the Secretariat, the entire Board will be briefed on the situation so that each Board member may form their own opinion about the member of concern.","Voting is particularly important for the CVE Board because it is the means by which the Board makes decisions about the strategic direction of the program, and how the program will be governed and operated. Therefore, Board members have a responsibility to participate by voting. Members will lose voting privileges if they do not vote in at least one of the three previous (consecutive) Board votes. Votes to abstain count toward participation and toward a quorum. Votes that are terminated before the stated voting period because an early decision is reached, do not count as a part of the three previous votes. Members may regain voting privileges by asking to have their voting privileges reinstated through the private mailing list or during a Board meeting. If members have not voted in the past year, they can be removed from the Board by a Board vote, following the procedures for forced removal. If there are multiple Board members from a single organization then the above applies to the organizational members, not the individual members.

One thing that accelerated our need to better organize and handle incoming vulnerabilities was the acquisition of TippingPoint in late 2015, which included The <a target=\\"_blank\\" href=\\"https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/\\">The Zero Day Initiative (ZDI)</a> the world’s largest vendor-agnostic bug bounty program.

As you can imagine, even though it was a slam dunk for ZDI to pursue becoming a CNA, it was not as obvious a path for Trend Micro’s vulnerability response team to pursue. From a defensive perspective, there was still a strong belief by some that trying not to draw attention to vulnerabilities via the exposure of issuing more CVE IDs was the way to go.

By owning up to them and being able to resolve them via responsible disclosure, we can much better protect our customers and users by limiting their exposure as best as possible. Because CVE is the de facto standard (e.g., the “common language” of vulnerability disclosures)—we can ensure that we can effectively communicate to our users the need to mitigate and patch."},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"Once we became a CNA, it wasn’t just a matter of integrating CVEs into our regular disclosure process—that part was pretty straightforward. In the beginning, the whole process of having to do an additional CVE ID submission with a specific format in additional to our regular security bulletins seemed like it was adding extra overhead; but in retrospect, by frontloading the work—meaning ensuring that our own security bulletins used most of the required CVE ID submission information—we were able to improve the quality of our own bulletins as well as streamlining the overall disclosure process. CVEs are great in that they can just as easily be used for internal cataloging as well as external disclosure."},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"A lot of the real value we realized in the program was in the interactions with other CNAs—many of our peers (and competitors), as well as those beyond our own industry. Joining some of the ample workgroups in the CVE Program has allowed us to share ideas and realize that some of the challenges we faced were not unique to us. The combination of the largest companies and smaller ones allows many voices to be heard—as well as the inclusion of vulnerability hunters and research organizations that give us insight into what they are looking for and their struggles with vendors such as ourselves. The CNA program is comprised of an organized group of like-minded security professionals, and it is very easy to contribute to, and gain a lot in return. The experiences not only have improved our overall vulnerability response, but we have been able to apply some of our learnings to enrich our overall proactive secure development processes to stamp out potential issues in early development stages."},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"As security breaches and exploits become an all-too-common headline in recent days, vulnerability discovery and disclosure are an increasingly important and very visible part of the landscape.

CNAs-LR also assign CVE IDs, but their scopes cover all vulnerabilities for their Root CNA that are not already covered by one of its Sub-CNAs.","Finally, while not a type of CNA, the <strong>Secretariat</strong> role supports many of the CNA functions (such as providing infrastructure and publishing the CVE List) and therefore is included in this document.","Each of the different types of CNAs, and the Secretariat, are roles that can be fulfilled by any organization that meets the requirements. These roles are not mutually exclusive, and a single organization can fulfill more than one of these roles at the same time.

Examples of such issues would be a CNA being unresponsive beyond expected timeframes or a disagreement with a CNA over whether or not an issue is a vulnerability. Requests and issues at the Sub-CNA level can be elevated to Root CNAs, and requests and issues at the Root CNAs can be elevated to the Program Root CNA. The Program Root CNA has the right to require remediation or impose sanctions on CNAs (of any type) that do not comply with the CNA Rules; however, Root CNAs are the main enforcement mechanism. Root CNAs are responsible for enforcing the rules within their area of responsibility; the Program Root CNA is the enforcement mechanism of last resort. The Root CNAs have the same level of enforcement ability as the Program Root CNA, including remediation or sanctions, within their areas of responsibility, which enables the federation of the CVE Program by implementing a de-centralized governance approach.","Examples of remediation and sanctions include, but are not limited, to:<ul><li>The development of training, guidance, or implementation materials for use by the CNAs;</li><li>Retraining of CNA staff;</li><li>Additional process documentation and reporting from a CNA;</li><li>Reduction of the number of CVE IDs a CNA has available to assign at a time;</li><li>Rejection of CVE Entry submissions; and</li><li>Revocation of CNA status.</li></ul>","The same flow, from Sub-CNAs to Root CNAs to the Program Root CNA, is followed to alert the next higher CNA when CVEs are assigned, or when reporting other programmatic data (see Figure 2, below).
